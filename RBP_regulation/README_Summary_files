Summary files

We merged the list of all differentially edited (DE) sites corresponding to 
each RBP-KD sample from the same cell line, HepG2 or K562.  

These sites were further annotated based on the gene, genomic region and alu
elements that they overlap. 


Columns:
1. Cell line where the RBP was knocked down
2. RBP that was knocked-down. 
3. Editing site coordinate
4. Tag. DE for differentially edited, NS for non-significant or non differential
5. Editing type e.g. AG = A to G editing.
6. Editing ratio in the KD sample
7. Mean editing ratio in the batch
8. Mean coverage in the KD sample replicates
9. P-value for the change in editing (KD vs Batch mean)
10. Gene that overlaps this site. For multiple genes, they are ';' separated.
11. Genomic region that overlaps this site. In the case of multiple regions overlapping 
  this site, we use the following order of priority: 
  UTR3, exon, ncRNA_exon, intron, ncRNA_intron, UTR5, intergenic 
12. Alu-overlap. Whether this site overlaps a sense-alu element, antisense, or doesn't 
  overlap an Alu at all.
13. Batch name. 
14. P-value, BH-corrected for multiple testing.
