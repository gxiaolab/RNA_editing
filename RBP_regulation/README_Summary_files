Summary files

These files contain all differentially edited (DE) sites corresponding to all 
RBP-KD samples from each cell line, HepG2 and K562. 

Columns:
1. Cell line where the RBP was knocked down
2. RBP that was knocked-down. 
3. Editing site coordinate
4. Tag. DE for differentially edited, NS for non-significant or non differential
5. Editing type e.g. AG = A to G
6. Editing ratio in the KD sample
7. Mean editing ratio in the batch
8. Mean coverage in the KD sample replicates
9. P-value for the change in editing (KD vs Batch mean)
10. Gene that overlaps this site. For multiple genes, they are ';' separated.
11. Alu-overlap. Whether this site overlaps a sense-alu element, antisense, or doesn't 
  overlap an Alu at all.
12. Batch name. 
13. P-value, BH-corrected for multiple testing.
