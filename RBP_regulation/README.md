# Contents 
- Summary files: Lists of Differentially Edited (DE) sites found in our study. Further description of 
  these files is provided in [Summary files description](./README_Summary_files)

  - [Differentially edited sites in K562](./Summary.all_de_sites.all_rbps.HepG2.new_fdr_corr.final.header.tab)
- [DEMO](./demo): Detailed description of the differential editing calculation. It includes the scripts necessary and test samples. 
- [ADAR DE sites and binding sites](./ADAR_CLIP_peak_distance_to_editing_sites.HepG2_and_K562_sites.tab.gz): List of differentially-edited sites (in ADAR1-KD in HepG2 and K562) and their proximity to ADAR1 binding sites. 
- List of differentially-edited sites (in different RBP-KD's in HepG2 and K562) and their proximity to their corresponding RBP binding sites.
