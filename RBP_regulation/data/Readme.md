Example of Input datasets for differential editing analysis.

These input files correspond to editing sites from 3 samples: 2 RBP-KD
(ADAR and DHX30) and one control (CONTROL305XWT). Each sample has 2 
biological replicates. These 3 samples belong to the same batch named after 
the control sample.

The Input files contain the following fields:

Chromosome, position, editing type, # edited reads, # total reads
